  An interepreter for a concatenative functional language
based on combinators. Mostly based on the concepts expressed in:

  "The Theory of Concatenative Combinators by Brent Kerby"
  ([link](http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html#applic))
 
  Gerku is intended to explore the same space as the `mlatu`
project using a stack based semantics rather than rewriting rules.
The aim is to verify that the two are, indeed, equivalent.

  mlatu is a project by Caden Haustein (carmysilna)
